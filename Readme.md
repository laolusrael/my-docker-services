# Docker Repository

This repository contains resources and examples related to Docker containerization. The content is designed to help users understand, build, and manage Docker containers for various applications.

## Contents

- **Dockerfile**: Example Dockerfiles for building custom container images.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Sample Docker Compose files to orchestrate multi-container applications.
- **README.md**: Documentation and instructions for using the repository.
- **Scripts/**: Useful scripts for building, running, and managing Docker containers.
- **Examples/**: Sample projects and configurations demonstrating Docker best practices.
- **.env.example**: Example environment variable file for configuring Docker Compose setups.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```
   cd docker
   ```
3. Build and run containers using Docker or Docker Compose as described in the relevant example folders.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (if using `docker-compose.yml`)

## Excluding Container-Generated Files

All files generated by Docker containers (such as runtime data, logs, and volumes) should be excluded from version control. This is typically handled by adding the relevant paths (e.g., `data/`, `logs/`, or other volume mount points) to the `.gitignore` file.  
**Example:**  
```
**/data/*
**/logs/*
```
Make sure to update `.gitignore` to match the directories used by your containers.
